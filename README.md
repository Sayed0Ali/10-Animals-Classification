# 10 Animals Classification

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying 10 different animals using a Jupyter notebook. The implementation is done in Google Colab for easy access to GPU resources and cloud computing capabilities.

## Project Structure
- `10_Animals_Classification` : Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10
- `10_Animals_Classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by Git
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Setup Instructions

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the model
3. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (they will be installed automatically in the notebook)

## Requirements

The notebook includes all necessary package installations. The main dependencies include:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other dependencies as specified in the notebook

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the model

## Note

This project is designed to run in Google Colab environment. Make sure you have a Google account and access to Google Colab to run the notebook.
